/*! @class Simulation

   The Simulation class is the main class in this program. It constructs the \ref Network according to user-specified parameters, and *run()* "runs" the simulation.

   Simulation results are printed to output files. Files are named according to what they contains (spikes, parameters or values of a sample of neurons).

   A Simulation is mainly made of a number of time steps \ref simulationDuration and a \ref Network, which contains pointers to \ref Neurone objects. These neurons are constructed and linked randomly. The simulation is either created according to user inputs or with default values.

   The map \ref neuronsProportions describes the neuron population (see \ref constants.h) :
   The key is the neuron type from \ref Neuron::NeuronTypes and the associated value is the number of this neuron type in the simulation.

The right way to enter neurons proportions is to write the type in capital letter, write ":" and then specify the proportion (between 0 and 1). Each proportions must be separated by a comma. For exemple \b IB:0.2,FS:0.3,CH:0.2 will create a network with 20% IB, 30% FS, 20% CH and 30% RS. By default, the remaining neurons needed to have the right number of neurons will be of type RS. If the proportions are not well entered, the default ones will be used (IB:0.1,LTS:0.2,FS:0.3,CH:0.2).
